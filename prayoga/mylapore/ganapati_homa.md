# Introduction

ॐ शुक्लाम्बरधरं विष्णुं शशिवर्णं चतुर्भुजम्।  
प्रसन्नवदनं ध्यायेत् सर्वविघ्नोपशान्तये॥

Whenever we start any activity, reciting the śloka above helps us complete the activity without hindrance. Even Mahāviṣṇu, Śiva and the Devas pray to Ganeśa to remove obstacles before undertaking any activity. When the devas started to churn the ‘Paarkadal’ for amr̥ta, there were obstacles. On offering their prayers to Ganeśa, those obstacles were eliminated. Śri Tyāgarāja svāmi – a Rāma bhakta – started his song compoisition with a ganeśa stuti.Similarly Śri Tulasīdās, before writing the Hindi Rāmāyaṇa, starts his first śloka with prayer to Ganeśa.

Ganeśaa is called by different names – gajānana, ekadanta, vighneśvara etc. Just as pure gold shines in very ornament that is fashioned from it, Ganeśa gives us his great blessings – whatever the name we call him.

(गणानां जीव-जातानां यः ईशः सः गणेशः).

He is called Ganeśa since he is the adhipati of all living beings. He is called Gajānana / Lambodara since he appears with an elephant-face and has a stout stature. He is all-pervasive and is as powerful as an elephant in removing obstacles.

When Veda Vyāsa wanted to write the Mahābhārata, he decided that Ganeśa was the right person to act as the scribe for the big epic. Thus, he prayed to Ganeśa. Ganeśa acceded to the request, provided Veda Vyāsa recite the verses in one continuous stream,  thus matching the speed of Ganeśa’s writing without any break. Veda Vyasa agreed but said that Ganeśa should only write the verses with an understanding of their meaning. While Ganeśa wrote the verses as they were being recited by Veda vyasa, the writing tool broke. To continue writing, it is believed that Ganeśa broke one of his tusks and completed the work with it. Thus, he is called Ekadanta.
Once, in order to prevent others from entering her place, Pārvatī made a pratimā (likeness) using the turmeric from her body. This became Ganeśa. Pārvatī placed Ganeśa outside to prevent anyone’s entry. When Ṣiva came, he was not allowed entry by Ganeśa  Ṣiva became angry and chopped off the head of Ganeśa. Then, on Pārvatī’s order, he was brought alive again by placing an elephant face and hence became Gajamukha.

कण्ठाधो मायया युतं मस्तकं ब्रह्मवाचकम्॥

Ganeśa’s head  is said to represent the praṇava (om) and is considered to be the complete brahma svarūpa. The  first five letters of the Gaṇapati mūla mantra represents five yugma devatās (pairs of devatās). In the dhyāna ślokas for each of the yugma devatas, there are 2 to 10 weapons specified

- श्रीं – Ramā; Ramāpati (Viṣṇu) – śaṅkha, cakra
- ह्रीं – Girijā (Pārvatī) – pāśa, aṅkuśa; Girijāpati (Parameśvara)
- क्लीं – Rati; Ratipati (Manmatha) – sugarcane bow, nīlotpala flower
- ग्लौं – Mahī (earth); Mahīpati) – gadhā of Varāhamūrti / grain kadhir
- गं – Mahālakṣmī; Mahāgaṇapati – Pomegranate, broken tusk. In one hand the śaṅkha, pāśa, nīlotpala puṣpa, grain kadhir, and in another hand the singel tusk.

In the Vedas, the Gaṇapati sūkta, Brahmaṇaspati sūktam, and Gaṇapati atharvaśīrṣa are for Ganeśa. In the Śukla yajur veda, the ‘gaṇānāṁ tvā’ mantra says “I call the one who is the adhipati of the gaṇas, the one who is the adhipati of wishes, and the one who is the adhipati of all aiśvaryas”. By doing upāsana of this mantra, all aiśvaryas will be attained and all wishes will be fulfilled.

## Days to propitiate Ganesa

He is born on śukla caturthī. So upāsanā of him on śukla caturthī is supposed to give immense benefits.
During kr̥ṣṇapakṣa caturthwhen one observes a fast for the whole day and then propitiates Ganeśa during  moonrise, it is supposed to remove all worries and obstacles. Hence he is also called Saṅkaṭahara.
He can be worshipped on Fridays too.

कलौ चण्डी-विनायकौ

In kali yuga, he gives immediate benefits to all those who worship him through abhiśeka, archanā, mūla mantra japa, homa, caturāvr̥tti tarpana, and to those vho do thoppu karaṇam after tapping their head with the closed fist.

संपूजितो विघ्नराट् कुर्यादित्युषसि स्मृतः सः।  
सकलान् कामांस्तथा तर्पितः॥

Whoever propitiates Gaṇeśa in the uṣa kāla (at dawn) gets all noble thoughts. Thus, in Kerala, uṣa kāla is considered the ideal time for Gaṇapati homa. In Gaṇapati homa, kāla, mūla and nāla are considered to be very important.

- Kāla – Time: uṣa kāla (i.e. dawn).
- Mūla – Mūla mantra.
- Nāla – Thin slices of coconut.

In Tamil Nadu, the gaṇapati homa is done elaborately after sunrise.

मोदक-पृथुक-सलाजाः स सक्तवः सेक्षु-नारिकेलतिलाः।  
कदलीफल-सहितानि इत्यष्टद्रव्याणि संप्रतीष्टानि॥

Modaka, puffed rice, flattened rice, saththumavu, sugarcane, coconut slices, sesame seeds and banana should me mixed with honey, milk and ghee and should be offered in homa.

Each day, 28, 108 or 1008 offerings can be made. In the prapañca sāra, it is mentioned that japa, homa and tarpaṇa should be perfomed in fours (i.e like 44, 444, 4444 etc).

## Significance of modaka

The tasteless flour used to make the modaka is considered to signify māyā; while the tasty sweet pūraṇam inside signifies jñāna.

ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते।   
पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते॥

Benefits of different dravyas in homa

- Modaka – Wishes get fulfilled.
- Saththu maavu – ability to attract everyone.
- Coconut slices – all aiśvaryas (prosperity)
- Sugarcane – Attraction of all human beings.
- Bananas – All obstacles will be removed.
- Sesame seeds – Sins will be removed and apamr̥tyu doṣha gets removed, attraction of deities.
- Flattened rice – Health
- Puffed rice – kanyā lābha and vara lābha (getting a worthy spouse)
- Honey – Money, prosperity, gold
- Milk – will beget more cows
- Ghee – Lakṣmī’s grace and tejas.
- Arul grass – long life
- Samith – Victory in all activities.

Any one who has Ketu doṣa, should propitiate Ganeśa to beget the benefits.

## Benefits of homa

Unmarried men / women can do homa with puffed rice and trimadhuram with 444 āvr̥ttis or 108 mūla mantra japa for 7 days continuously starting from śukla prathamā to get marriage prāpti.

If the homa is done in the same manner for 4 days from śukla prathamā, then  one gets the power to attract human beings.

If the homa is done every śukla caturthī, then prosperity increases.

If one does homa with a whole coconut and honey each day for 44 days, they will attain everything desired.

Reciting atharvaśīrṣa before or after the homa gives great benefits. Doing homa with mantras of atharvaśīrṣa begets a lot of benefits.

## Tarpaṇa

First offer 12 tarpaṇas using the mūla mantra.
Then add Gaṇapati’s name to each akṣara and offer 4 tarpaṇas for each akṣara.

Then offer 28 tarpaṇas using 4 moola mantra. Then do 4 tharpanams for:
(a)	Yugma devatās of 5 akṣaras – śrīdevī and mahāviṣṇu; pārvati and parameśvara, rati and manmatha, bhūmi and varāha, mahāgaṇapati and mahālakṣmī.
(b)	Yukma devathas of 6 angles (6 konam), 2 parsva devatas, 2 yukma devatas, 8 purusha devatas, 8 sthree devatas.
(c)	Between these, 4 tarpaṇas should be offered using the mūla mantra for a grand total of 444 tarpaṇas
Homa bhasma can be used as vibhūti; or can be put in a pit which is covered with sand; or can be put in a place where people do not walk.

If one starts the Gaṇapati homa for the first time, then it is auspicious to first perform Vigneśvara pūjā for haridrā Gaṇeśa. If one is doing the homa every month, then a separate Vigneśvara pūjā is not required.
Let us perform upāsanā of Gaṇapati – who can fulfill all our wishes – and become prosperous.

समपूजकानां परिपालकानां यतेन्द्रियाणां च तपोधनानाम्।  
देशस्य राष्ट्रस्य कुलस्य राज्ञः करोतु शान्तिं भगवान् गणेशः॥

(The Gaṇapati homa prayoga differs based on region. This prayoga is written after consulting many paṇḍitas in this region, i.e. Tamil Nadu.)

ब्रह्म॑ जज्ञा॒नम् - प्र॒थ॒मम् - पु॒रस्ता॑॑त् - विसी॑म॒तः - सु॒रुचः॑ - वे॒न आ॑वः - स बु॒ध्नियाः॑॑ - उ॒प॒माः - अ॒स्य॒वि॒ष्ठाः - स॒तश्च॒ योनि॑॑म् - अस॑तश्च॒ विवः॑॥

With the mantra above, draw a line in the middle from west to east.
{: .eng-vidhi}

नाके॑ सुप॒र्णम् - उ॒प॒यत् - पत॑न्तं - हृ॒दा - वेन॑न्तः - अ॒भ्यच॑क्षतत्त्वा - हिर॑ण्यपक्षं - वरु॑णस्य - दू॒तं - य॒मस्य॒ - योनिं॑॑ - शकु॒नम् - भु॒र॒ण्युम्।

With the mantra above, draw a line in the northern side from west to east.

With the mantra above, draw a line in the east from south to north.
{: .eng-vidhi}

With दर्भान्निरस्य, the darbha in the hand should be discarded to the north.  अप उपस्पृश्य. Water should be touched.
{: .eng-vidhi}

On top of this ullekhana (in the center) a kalaśa should be placed (It should be made of one of gold, silver, copper, brass or pañcaloha. Vessels made of any other material should be avoided)
{: .eng-vidhi}

Recite the mantra below and then place the kumbha.
{: .eng-vidhi}

ब्रह्म॑ जज्ञा॒नम् - प्र॒थ॒मम् - पु॒रस्ता॑॑त् - विसी॑म॒तः - सु॒रुचः॑ - वे॒न आ॑वः - स बु॒ध्नियाः॑॑ - उ॒प॒माः - अ॒स्य॒वि॒ष्ठाः - स॒तश्च॒ योनि॑॑म् - अस॑तश्च॒ विवः॑॥

While touching the kumbha (filled with water) with some darbha, the mantras below should be recited.
{: .eng-vidhi}

आपो॒ वा इ॒दꣳ सर्व॑॑म् - विश्वा॑ भू॒तान्यापः॑ - प्रा॒णा वा आपः॑ - प॒शव॒ आपः॑ - अन्न॒मापः॑ - अमृ॑त॒मापः॑ - स॒म्राडापः॑ - वि॒राडापः॑ - स्व॒राडापः॑ - छन्दा॒ꣳस्यापः॑ - ज्योती॒ꣳष्यापः॑ - यजू॒ꣳष्यापः॑ - स॒त्यमापः॑ - सर्वा॑ दे॒वता॒ आपः॑ - भूर्भुवः॒सुवः॑ - आप॒ ॐ॥

{: .eng-vidhi}

(१) अ॒पः प्रण॑यति। श्र॒द्धा वै - आप॑। श्र॒द्धां - ए॒वारभ्य॑ - प्र॒णीय॑ - प्रच॑रति।  
(२) अ॒पः प्रण॑यति। य॒ज्ञो वै - आप॑। य॒ज्ञं - ए॒वारभ्य॑ - प्र॒णीय॑ - प्रच॑रति।

आपो॒ वै - शा॒न्ताः।  शा॒न्ताभिः॑ - ए॒वास्य॑ - शुच॑॑म् -  शमयति॥

Now take 2 darbhas between the two hands (with tips facing north). With the three sentences below, purify (utpavanam) the water three times by moving the darbhas in the kalasha water from west to east. The darbhas should be held in the hands with palms upwards and should be held between the ring and thumb fingers of each hand. Once the utpavanam is complete, these two darbhas should be placed inside the kumbha with tips facing up.
{: .eng-vidhi}

दे॒वो वः॑ - स॒वि॒ता - उत्पु॑नतु। अच्छि॑द्रेण - प॒वित्रे॑ण।
वसोः॑॑ - सूर्य॑स्य - र॒श्मिभिः।

स हि रत्ना॑नि - दा॒शुषे॑॑ - सु॒वाति॑ - स॒वि॒ता भगः।
तं भा॒गं - चि॒त्रिमी॑महे॥

With the mantras above, a gold or silver coin should be placed in the kumbha.
{: .eng-vidhi}

कूर्चाग्रैः राक्षसान् घोरान् छिन्धि कर्म-विघातिनः।  
त्वामर्पयामि कुम्भेऽस्मिन् साफल्यं कुरु कर्मणि॥

Then with the mantras above, a kūrca should be placed on top of the kalaśa.

{: .eng-vidhi}

सर्वे समुद्राः सरितस्तीर्थानि च नदा ह्रदाः।  
आयान्तु मम सहकुटुम्बस्य दुरितक्षयकारकाः॥

Saying this, the kalaśa should be touched.
{: .eng-vidhi}

इ॒मं मे॑ वरुण श्रुधी॒ हव॑म॒द्या च॑ मृडय। त्वाम॑व॒स्युराच॑के॥  
तत्त्वा॑ यामि॒ ब्रह्म॑णा॒ वन्द॑मान॒स्तदाशा॑॑स्ते॒ यज॑मानो ह॒विर्भिः॑।  
अहे॑डमानो वरुणे॒ह बो॒ध्युरु॑शꣳ स॒ मा न॒ आयुः॒ प्र मो॑षीः॥  
ॐ भूर्भुवः॒सुव॒रोम् अस्मिन् कुम्भे सकल-तीर्थाधिपतिं वरुणं ध्यायामि॥

Saying this, akṣata should be offered.
{: .eng-vidhi}

वरुणं आवाहयामि।

Saying this, akṣata should be placed. (Contemplate on varuṇa and invite him. With that belief, he will be present)
{: .eng-vidhi}

Now with the mahāgaṇapati mantra, a silver idol of mahāgaṇapati should be placed on top of the kalaśa. (Alternatively, a coin can be used in place of the likeness). Mahāgaṇapati should then be invoked there. (In some traditions a lamp is placed and durgā is invoked and worshipped). (The mahāgaṇapati mūla mantra upadeśa should be received from a qualified guru, and thus, the mūla mantra is not given here)  
{: .eng-vidhi}

## न्यासः
